# captcha-service

Server-side companion to the iOS TurnBridge NetworkExtension. Hosts
the VK captcha + identity-registration pipeline outside the
50-100 MB iOS sandbox so the heavy work (slider rendering, PoW
solving, the 8-RT VK auth flow) runs on a real machine with proper
memory and proper DNS.

The server does **not** open TURN allocations on behalf of the
client — TURN allocations are bound by RFC 5766 to the 5-tuple that
issued them and can't be handed off. What the server does is the
captcha + auth flow, then returns the `{user, pass, addr}` triple
from VK's `vchat.joinConversationByLink` response. The iOS client
uses those credentials to issue its own `Allocate` from the
phone's source IP, within VK's ~50 s rotation window.

## Why this exists

Per-IP captcha rate-limit (`ERROR_LIMIT`) caps the iOS client at
roughly 8 unique identities per `connect`. The other ceiling — the
49-candidate slider ranker allocating ~70 MB transiently — was
already softened in F5 but still constrains how many solves can run
in parallel. Moving captcha solving to a server with its own IP
budget and gigabytes of RAM lifts both ceilings.

Each server instance gives the fleet **one** fresh per-IP budget
(`directSaturated` cools down 60 s after `ERROR_LIMIT`). Run several
behind a round-robin load balancer or rotating residential proxies
for multiplicative throughput.

## Running locally

```sh
go run . # requires API_KEY env
```

```sh
API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 16) go run .
```

The service listens on `:8080` by default. Healthcheck at
`GET /healthz`, stats snapshot at `GET /stats` (unauthenticated).

## API

`POST /cred` — solve one captcha + register one VK identity, return
ready-to-use TURN creds.

```http
POST /cred HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{"link": "<vk-call-join-link>"}
```

Successful response (typical 2-10 s):

```json
{
  "user": "1715792025:guest",
  "pass": "abc123…",
  "addr": "95.163.34.151:3478",
  "expires_at": "2026-05-15T07:45:00Z"
}
```

Error responses:
- `400` — missing/invalid `link`.
- `401` — missing or wrong bearer token.
- `429` — egress is in the 60 s `ERROR_LIMIT` cooldown. Client
  should back off until `Retry-After` (header) seconds elapse.
- `502` — captcha pipeline failed (downstream VK returned
  something we can't parse, or captcha solving exhausted retries).
- `503` — solve queue full (more than `maxConcurrentCaptchaSolves`
  in flight; client backoff and retry).

## Environment

| Var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | bind address |
| `API_KEY` | *(required)* | bearer token clients must send |
| `CAPTCHA_TRAP_DIR` | `./trap` | where to write debug artefacts for failed solves (slider images, etc.) |
| `WARP_INTERFACE` | *(unset)* | name of a pre-existing WireGuard interface (typically Cloudflare WARP) to pin VK-bound HTTP sockets to. See **WARP egress** below |

## WARP egress

In mid-2026 VK rolled out per-source-IP traffic-shaping on captcha
endpoints. Hosts that solve many captchas in a short window get
throttled or temp-blacklisted by source IP. Routing the captcha
service's outbound HTTP through Cloudflare's WARP (free WireGuard
tunnel) moves egress to Cloudflare's IP space, which VK has not been
observed to throttle (so far).

The captcha-service does NOT manage the WireGuard interface itself —
key generation, registration with Cloudflare, and `wg-quick`
lifecycle stay at the OS layer. We only consume an interface name and
bind sockets to it via `SO_BINDTODEVICE`.

### Operator setup

1. **Get WARP credentials** with `wgcf` (https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf):

   ```sh
   wgcf register
   wgcf generate
   mv wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard/wgcf.conf
   ```

2. **Edit `/etc/wireguard/wgcf.conf`** and add `Table = off` to the
   `[Interface]` section so wg-quick doesn't install default routes
   (we only want VK traffic on WARP, not all egress):

   ```ini
   [Interface]
   PrivateKey = ...
   Address = 172.16.0.2/32, 2606:4700:110:.../128
   Table = off                                          # <-- add this
   MTU = 1280
   ```

3. **Bring the interface up**:

   ```sh
   sudo wg-quick up /etc/wireguard/wgcf.conf
   ip link show wgcf                # confirm it exists
   ```

4. **Run captcha-service with `WARP_INTERFACE=wgcf`** and grant it
   `CAP_NET_RAW` so non-root processes can call `SO_BINDTODEVICE`:

   ```sh
   docker run -d \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     -e API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
     -e WARP_INTERFACE=wgcf \
     --cap-add=NET_RAW \
     --network=host \
     turnbridge/captcha-service
   ```

   `--network=host` is required so the container shares the host's
   network namespace and can see the `wgcf` interface.

5. **Verify**:

   ```sh
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/stats | jq .warp
   # "on:wgcf"
   ```

   Then trigger a `/cred` call and check the WARP interface counters
   went up (`wg show wgcf transfer`).

### Falling back

Unset `WARP_INTERFACE` (or simply don't pass it) and outbound goes via
the host's default route again. No code change, no restart of the
WireGuard interface — captcha-service just doesn't pin sockets.

## Deployment (Docker)

```sh
docker build -t turnbridge/captcha-service .
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 16) \
  -v $(pwd)/trap:/var/trap \
  --name captcha-service \
  turnbridge/captcha-service
```

The container uses a non-root `app` user and exposes a `wget`-based
healthcheck on `/healthz`.

## Concurrency

`maxConcurrentCaptchaSolves = 5` matches the iOS client's pacing.
VK trips `ERROR_LIMIT` more aggressively when more than ~5-6 solves
land on the same source IP in the same 60 s window. Scale capacity
by adding more peers on different IPs (see Cluster mode below),
not by raising this limit on one instance.

## Cluster mode (V2)

Every binary is symmetric. The peer the client hits acts as
**master** for that request: it round-robins through the configured
peer list (including itself), forwards to `/internal/cred` when
round-robin lands on a different peer, and falls through to the
next peer on `429`. Single-node mode (no `PEERS`) is the default
and matches V1 behaviour.

### Deployment

Run one captcha-service per IP. Each binary needs to know all
peers in the fleet. Example for 3 nodes on different VPS:

```sh
# Node A (77.90.8.199)
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e API_KEY=$SHARED_KEY \
  -e SELF_URL=http://77.90.8.199:8080 \
  -e PEERS='http://77.90.8.199:8080|'$SHARED_KEY',http://77.90.8.200:8080|'$SHARED_KEY',http://77.90.8.201:8080|'$SHARED_KEY \
  --name cs turnbridge/captcha-service

# Node B (77.90.8.200) — same PEERS list, different SELF_URL
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e API_KEY=$SHARED_KEY \
  -e SELF_URL=http://77.90.8.200:8080 \
  -e PEERS='http://77.90.8.199:8080|'$SHARED_KEY',http://77.90.8.200:8080|'$SHARED_KEY',http://77.90.8.201:8080|'$SHARED_KEY \
  --name cs turnbridge/captcha-service

# Node C (77.90.8.201) — analogous
```

`PEERS` format: comma-separated `URL|API_KEY` entries. `SELF_URL`
must exactly match one of the `PEERS` URLs so the binary recognises
itself and bypasses HTTP when round-robin picks it. Different
peers can use different API keys (each entry carries its own); the
common pattern is one shared key across the whole fleet.

### Saturation propagation

Each peer tracks its own VK rate-limit cooldown locally
(`directSaturated()` flips on `ERROR_LIMIT` and auto-clears after
60 s). When a master forwards to a peer and the peer returns `429`
or sets `X-Captcha-Self-Saturated: 1` on its response, the master
records "peer X cool down until now + 60 s" and skips X in
subsequent rounds. No gossip / heartbeats — saturation is learned
passively from response headers.

`GET /stats` includes the master's view of each peer's availability.

### Client config

The client always talks to ONE master URL. To survive a single-node
outage, either:

- Front the cluster with a load balancer / DNS round-robin (single
  client URL → many backend nodes).
- Or accept that "master" is whichever node the client points at
  and live-edit the URL when needed.

### HTTP path summary

- `POST /cred` — public, client-facing. Master logic; forwards.
- `POST /internal/cred` — peer-only. Same auth as `/cred` but
  never forwards. Sets `X-Captcha-Self-Saturated: 1` when this
  peer is in its 60 s cooldown.
- `GET /stats` — counters + peer-view snapshot.
- `GET /healthz` — for Docker HEALTHCHECK.
